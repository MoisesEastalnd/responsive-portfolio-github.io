        <p>Hi,My names is Moises Eastland and I’m inventory specialist at a medical supply warehouse.I’m currently attending a coding bootcamp to sharpen and increase my skills in coding. I would like someday become a web developer.</p><br></br> <p>I find coding interesting and very challenging. But like the old saying goes,“Things that come easy tend not to last.”Although frontend is said to be the lighter side of full-stack development. I want to try my hand in this part of the industry first, but I’m sure i will gravitate to where ever I’m strongest.</p>
